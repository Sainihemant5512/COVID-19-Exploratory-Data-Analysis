COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Description
This project provides an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the global COVID-19 dataset. The goal is to analyze the spread of COVID-19, the impact on various countries, and the trends in confirmed, active, and recovered cases over time.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the COVID-19 clean complete dataset which includes the following columns:

Province/State: Name of the province or state (if applicable).

Country/Region: Name of the country or region.

Lat: Latitude of the region.

Long: Longitude of the region.

Date: Date of the recorded data.

Confirmed: Number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Deaths: Number of deaths due to COVID-19.

Recovered: Number of recovered individuals.

Active: Number of active COVID-19 cases.

WHO Region: The WHO region to which the country belongs.

Key Findings
Confirmed COVID-19 Cases Over Time: The confirmed cases have risen consistently across the globe.

Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases: The United States, India, and Brazil were the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the period of analysis.

Trends in Confirmed Cases: Significant peaks in confirmed cases were observed between July and December 2020.

Visualizations
Confirmed COVID-19 Cases Over Time: A line plot showing the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases globally.

Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases: A bar plot highlighting the top 10 countries with the highest confirmed cases.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install them using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit

Conclusion
The analysis shows a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases globally, with the USA, India, and Brazil being the most affected countries. Further analysis can explore recovery rates, deaths, and other factors that may influence the spread of COVID-19.# COVID-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
